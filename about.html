            Gravitational waves in relativity were first considered by Einstein in his 1916 article "Näherungsweise Integration der Feldgleichungen der Gravitation", where he
            used linearized theory to show that small perturbations of spacetime metric lead to wave equation and therefore gravitational waves propagation with speed of light.
            In 1918, Einstein published another article about gravitational waves, "Über Gravitationswelle", where he corrected and completed his 1916 work. This article also shows,
            that spherical system can not radiate energy in form of gravitational waves and that only transversal modes carry energy away from the system. In 1923 Eddington
            confirmed that longitudal waves are not physical (and do to carry energy) in an article "The Propagation of Gravitational Waves", where he managed to transform longitudal
            modes out.
            Einstein, however, considered existence of gravitational waves much earlier - he already lectured about gravitational waves at a conference in Wien in 1913.
            There is a record of a discussion between Einstein and Born from this conference, about propagation of such waves.

                                <i>Born:</i> I would like ask mister Einstein about the speed of propagation of gravitational waves according to his theory. It is not quite apparent to me
                                that it propagates with the speed of light...
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <i>Einstein:</i> It is rather easy to write down equations where perturbations are infinitesimal. In that case (metric components) g
                                differs only infinitesimaly from the case where perturbations are absent. Perturbations, however, propagate with the same speed as light does.

                            <p>
                                <i>Born:</i> But for large perturbations it surely gets very complicated?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <i>Einstein:</i> Yes, it is a mathematically difficult problem. Particulary it is hard to find exact solutions, because the equations are nonlinear.
                            </p>

              Einstein was aware that the speed of propagation should correspond to the speed of light even before he published the general theory in 1915.
              Despite Einsteins concern about difficulty of finding exact solutions, first exact solution describing gravitational wave was due to Brinkmann in 1925.
              In his study of conformal transformations of exact solutions, he found metric corresponding to <it>pp</it>-waves (plane fronted waves with parallel propagation).
              In todays terms, Brinkmann form of metric is in the form
              $$ \mathrm{d} s^2 = - \mathrm{d} u \mathrm{d} r - 2 H(\zeta \bar{\zeta}, u) \mathrm{d} u^2 + 2 \mathrm{d} \zeta \mathrm{d} \bar{\zeta}, $$
              where $H$ is a solution to the Laplace equation in the transverse space.
              Brinkmann derived the metric, however he was unaware of its physical importance as his study was focused on mathematical properties and not interpretation.
              Relevance of this metric was not appriciated until rediscovered...
