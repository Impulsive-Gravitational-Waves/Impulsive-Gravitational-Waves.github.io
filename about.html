            Gravitational waves in relativity were first considered by Einstein in his 1916 article "Näherungsweise Integration der Feldgleichungen der Gravitation", where he
            used linearized theory to show that small perturbations of spacetime metric lead to wave equation and therefore gravitational waves propagation with speed of light.
            In 1918, Einstein published another article about gravitational waves, "Über Gravitationswelle", where he corrected and completed his 1916 work. This article also shows,
            that spherical system can not radiate energy in form of gravitational waves and that only transversal modes carry energy away from the system. In 1923 Eddington
            confirmed that longitudal waves are not physical (and do to carry energy) in an article "The Propagation of Gravitational Waves", where he managed to transform longitudal
            modes out.
            Einstein, however, considered existence of gravitational waves much earlier - he already lectured about gravitational waves at a conference in Wien in 1913.
            There is a record of a discussion between Einstein and Born from this conference, about propagation of such waves.

                              <i>Born:</i> I would like ask mister Einstein about the speed of propagation of gravitational waves according to his theory. It is not quite apparent to me
                              that it propagates with the speed of light...
                          </p>
                          <p>
                              <i>Einstein:</i> It is rather easy to write down equations where perturbations are infinitesimal. In that case (metric components) g
                              differs only infinitesimaly from the case where perturbations are absent. Perturbations, however, propagate with the same speed as light does.

                          <p>
                              <i>Born:</i> But for large perturbations it surely gets very complicated?
                          </p>
                          <p>
                              <i>Einstein:</i> Yes, it is a mathematically difficult problem. Particulary it is hard to find exact solutions, because the equations are nonlinear.

              Einstein was aware that the speed of propagation should correspond to the speed of light even before he published the general theory in 1915.
              Despite Einsteins concern about difficulty of finding exact solutions, first exact solution describing gravitational wave was due to Brinkmann in 1925.
              In his study of conformal transformations of exact solutions, he found metric corresponding to <i>pp</i>-waves (plane fronted waves with parallel propagation).
              In todays terms, Brinkmann form of metric is in the form
              $$ \mathrm{d} s^2 = - \mathrm{d} u \mathrm{d} r - 2 H(\zeta, \bar{\zeta}, u) \mathrm{d} u^2 + 2 \mathrm{d} \zeta \mathrm{d} \bar{\zeta}, $$
              where $H$ is a solution to the Laplace equation in the transverse space.
              Although Brinkmann derived the metric, however he was unaware of its physical importance as his study was focused on mathematical properties and not interpretation.
              Brinkmann form of metric was interpreted much later by Robinson (1957) and independently by Peres (1959).

            <p>
              In 1926, Jeffery and Baldwin derived another exact solution
              $$ \mathrm{d} s^2 = -2 \mathrm{d} u \mathrm{d} v + g_{ij} (u) \mathrm{d} x^i \mathrm{d} x^j.$$
              This solution was rediscovered by Rosen in 1937 who interpreted it as a plane gravitational wave (with constant curvature along the wavefront).
              In the very same year, Rosen, this time together with Einstein, published another exact solution representing a gravitational wave, cylindrical in this case.
              These two publications, however, were accompanied by confusion about validity as the original conclusion, before prepublicaton review, pointed to the nonexistence
              of gravitational waves - Einstein and Rosen did some miscalcualtions.

              The theoretical existence of gravitational waves was not sure thing up to late 1957, when several articles (Pirani, Bonor, Bondi) rediscovered and interpreted gravitational wave spacetimes.
              It should be noted, that Brdička computed exact gravitational wave coupled with EM in 1951. The peak of the first era of gravitational waves was in 1959, when Bondi, Pirani and Robinson
              published study of spacetimes with gravitational waves, from pyhsical view. It was shown, that Rosen planar solution is special case of Brinkmann solution and first important step towards
              gravitational wave detectors was made - local analysis in terms of geodesic deviation equation was performed in several articles, including the famous 1959 one.
              After 1959, there was no doubt of theoretical existence of gravitational waves. In 1960, Robinson and Trautman described a family of expanding (spherical) impulsive gravitational waves
              $$ \mathrm{d} s^2 = -2 \mathrm{d} u \mathrm{d} r - 2 H \mathrm{d} u^2 + 2 \frac{r^2}{P^2} \mathrm{d} \eta \mathrm{d} \bar{\eta} $$
              (where $ 2H = \Delta \log P - 2r(\log P)_{,u} - \frac{2m}{r} - \frac{\Lambda}{3}r^2, \Delta = 2P \partial_{\eta} \partial_{\bar{\eta}} $)
              Only one year after that, in 1961, Kundt published study of family of non-expanding gravitational waves, that generalized Brinkmann solution,
              $$ \mathrm{d} s^2 = -2 \mathrm{d} u \left( \mathrm{d} r + H \mathrm{d} u + W \mathrm{d} \eta + \bar{W} \mathrm{d} \bar{\eta} \right) + 2P^{-2} \mathrm{d} \eta \mathrm{d} \bar{\eta},$$
              where $P(\eta, \bar{\eta}, u)$ and $H(\eta, \bar{\eta}, u, r)$ are real functions and $W(\eta, \bar{\eta}, u, r)$ is a complex function, all determined by field equations.

              Late 50s and early 60s could be called "the golden era of gravitational waves". Discontinuities on null characteristics were studied from mathematical point of view (Lichnerowicz 1955, Synge 1957)
              and new formalism in general relativity was formed - algebraic clasification and tetrad formalism helped in looking for radiative solutions.
              At this time, topological methods were first employed to study general relativity by Penrose. It took only few years for these methods to be used in
              construction in exact impulsive radiative spacetimes.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1972, Penrose published topological way to construct impulsive waves, the so called "cut and paste" method. This method, however, does not yield any form
              of a metric, continuous coordinate representation has to be found in order to construct exact metric in such a spacetime. This topological approach was not the only
              way of constructing impulsive waves. Aichelburg and Sexl performed a ultra-relativistic boost of Schwarzschild solution, where they increased velocity up to the speed of light
              while decreasing mass to 0, resulting in gravitational shock wave. Another way of construction was limit of sandwich waves, where the width of wave decreases while its intensity
              increases up to $\delta$-distribution like profile.
